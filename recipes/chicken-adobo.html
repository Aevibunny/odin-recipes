    <h3>Chicken Adobo is a type of Filipino chicken stew. Chicken pieces are marinated in soy sauce and spices, pan-fried, and stewed until tender.</h3>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken thighs</li>
        <li>White vinegar</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Black peppercorns</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken thighs in the adobo sauce for at least an hour, or as long as three hours. We put a cap on the marinade time because the white vinegar is super acidic, so it’ll start to mess with the texture of the chicken thighs after three hours.</li>
        <li>Brown the chicken thighs! They don’t need to be cooked through—focus on getting a nice golden-brown color and slightly crisp texture.</li>
        <li>Pour in the marinade and bring the chicken and sauce to a boil. Simmer until the sauce has reduced by half and the chicken is completely cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve over white rice and sprinkle with fresh chopped scallions.</li>
    </ol>
