Hello, my name is Kylie and this is my first attempt at creating a recipe website project. I hope to put the skills I've learned in html to the test and create something simple but well constructed.

Update 1: My goal with this update is to add CSS elements to make my recipes easier to read and to practice applying CSS to multiple pages to create a uniform look.
