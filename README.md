Hello, my name is Kylie and this is my first attempt at creating a recipe website project. I hope to put the skills I've learned in html to the test and create something simple but well constructed.

Update 1: My goal with this update is to add css elements to make my recipes easier to read and to practice applying css to multiple pages to create a uniform look.
Conclusion: using just a few modifiers on an external css sheet created a consistent and easy to read look. I learned a lot about combining internal and external css to avoid changing size of all images.
